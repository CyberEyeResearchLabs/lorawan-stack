Devices need to be registered with an application to communicate with The Things Stack. Let’s add one.

Login to https://thethings.example.com/. You will be taken to The Things Stack console.

>Replace https://thethings.example.com with the URL of your deployment. For example, <domain>.eu1.cloud.thethings.industries.

Click on **Go to Applications**, and then click on “**+ Add Application**” to reach the application registration page.

Fill and set the required fields:

- For **Application ID**, choose a unique ID of lower case, alphanumeric characters and nonconsecutive **-** and **_**
- For **Application Name**, give any suitable name to the application
- For **Description**, add anything you like
- Leave the **checkbox** checked to link automatically.

Click on **Create Application** to finish.

Once the application is created, you can find it in the Console under the **Applications** tab.
