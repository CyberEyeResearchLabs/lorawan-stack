What you see in the **Data** section of the device in The Things Stack console as below, is the raw payload in base64 format.

Letâ€™s decode that into meaningful message.

Go to **Payload Formatters** tab in The Things Stack console.

In **Formatter Type**, select **Javascript**.

{{< figure src="001_decoding_data.png" alt="Adding payload formatter code" >}}

In the **Formatter Parameter **box**, **paste the following code snippet:

```bash
function Decoder(bytes, port) {
 // Decode an uplink message from a buffer
 // (array) of bytes to an object of fields.
 var decoded = {};
 
 if (port === 1) decoded.led = bytes[0];
 
 return decoded;
}
```

The above code snippet does the following:

- **decoded.led = bytes[0]** will decode the base64 into base8 integer.
- **return decoded** will return the decoded message.

Go to the **Data** tab and click on any one of the recently received packets. You should be able to see the actual LED status in it as below.

Once you get the LED status in the final decoded form in The Things Stack,  you can follow the next section to add a MQTT Integration to it get the status of the LED in a custom application.
